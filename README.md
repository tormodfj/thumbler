Thumbler lets you resize a batch of images in one operation. Simply choose an input folder of images and an output folder where you want the resized images to end up, set the parameters for the resize operation og click the *Resize Images* button. The images produced are JPEGs with the size and quality specified by the parameters.

The resize process will search through the input folder and resize all images of the following formats:
  * JPEG
  * PNG
  * TIFF
  * BMP
  * GIF

Note that images are only downsized. If an image is already smaller than the specified size, it will keep its size when stored in the output folder.

Thumbler leverages features available in different Windows versions. On Windows XP, regular text boxes are used to present options and information:

On Windows Vista and newer, however, task dialogs are used:

If you are running Windows 7 and newer, Thumbler will use the taskbar to show the progress during resizing:
